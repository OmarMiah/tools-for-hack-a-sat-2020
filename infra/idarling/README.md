# IDArling server

We set up an [IDArling server](https://github.com/IDArlingTeam/IDArling) that
facilitates collaborative reverse engineering using IDA.

## Running the server

To build the docker images and run them, use the following command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

The IDArling service will be exposed on port 31013.
